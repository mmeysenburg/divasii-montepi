###Monte Carlo estimation of π

After cloning this repository, follow the directions in the 
`montepi.py` file to complete the Monte Carlo program. Then,
use the `condor_submit montepi.submit` command to launch ten
instances of the program. 

Once all ten instances have finished, download the `.out` files
and compute your estimate of π.
